## VS Code Settings
These are settings that are applied to the workspace, they line-up with our linting rules. These are not committed as each developer may have additional workspace configuration specific to them, IE Custom Colors per project.
These will most likely be a subset of your `.vscode/settings.json` file
Anyone is welcome to expand on these settings
```json
{
  "javascript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingNonemptyBraces": false,
  "typescript.format.insertSpaceAfterOpeningAndBeforeClosingNonemptyBraces": false,
  "typescript.preferences.importModuleSpecifier": "relative"
}
```
